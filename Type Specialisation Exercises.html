<h1>Type Specialisation Exercises</h1>

<h2>Power play</h2>
The <i>power</i> function, with a static first parameter, can be
defined as follows:
<pre>letrec power n x = if@ n=@ 1 then x else x*power (n-@1) x
in \x. power 3 x
</pre>
But this program cannot be specialised as it stands, because <tt>n</tt>
would need to be assigned several different residual types.
<ul>
<li> Solve the problem by making the <tt>power</tt> function
  polyvariant.
</li><li> Alternatively, make the <tt>power</tt> function unfoldable instead.
</li><li> Find a third solution, by using constructor specialisation to
  pass several different static arguments to <tt>power</tt>.
</li></ul>

<h2>Variations on append</h2>
The <i>append</i> function can be defined and tested as follows:
<pre>letrec append xs ys =
  case xs of
    Nil: ys,
    Cons x xs: Cons x (append xs ys)
  esac
in

append (Cons (lift 1) (Cons (lift 2) Nil)) (Cons (lift 3) Nil)
</pre>
So far all the list constructors are dynamic. Make the constructors of
the first argument static, to create a specialised version of
<i>append</i> for lists of length two. Now make the constructors of the
second argument and result static also. Do you understand why you
obtain the residual program that you do?

<h2>Experiments with Arity Raising</h2>
Experiment with the arity raiser, by giving the specialiser purely
dynamic terms containing pairs in different contexts, and examining
the output. For example, specialise
<pre>let f x = x in f (lift 1, lift 2)
</pre>
and
<pre>let proj x = case x of Inj y: y esac
in proj (Inj (lift 1, lift 2))
</pre>
Can you find a simple modification to these examples which avoids the
duplication of code? <i>Hint: insert a dynamic constructor somewhere.</i>

Why not define function composition, and a function <tt>swap</tt> which
swaps the components of pairs, and try composing <tt>swap</tt> with itself?

<h2>Simulating Constructor Specialisation: An Exercise in
  First-Class Polyvariance</h2>

One way to model data-structures in the pure lambda-calculus is as
follows. Model data values by functions from the branches of a
<b>case</b> over the datatype to the result of the <b>case</b>. Model
<b>case</b> branches by functions from the components to the result of
the branch. Model constructors by functions which select the
appropriate branch, and apply it to the components.
For example, lists can be modelled as follows:
<pre>nil c n = n
cons x xs c n = c x xs
listcase xs c n = xs c n
</pre>

If we apply this idea to a datatype with one unary constructor, we
obtain
<pre>inj x k = k x
caseinj x k = x k
</pre>
But suppose we want to model the behaviour of the specialisable
constructor <tt>In</tt>. By representing <b>case</b> branches as a 
<i>polyvariant</i> function, model constructor specialisation using
<tt>poly</tt> and <tt>spec</tt>.

<h2><a name="optspec">Optimal Specialisation</a></h2>
A self-interpreter for the specialiser's metalanguage can be
specialised <i>optimally</i> if, for any program <i>p</i>,
<pre> <i>mix int p = p</i> </pre>
(up to trivialities such as renaming of variables). If the
meta-language is typed, then an optimal specialiser <i>must</i>
specialise types, since otherwise this equation cannot hold for any
<i>p</i> containing a type not found in <i>int</i>. In particular, the
`universal' type used to represent values in the interpreter must be
specialised to the types of those values. The type specialiser was the
first to be able to do so for the lambda-calculus. In this
exercise, you will repeat this experiment.

Take the following typed interpreter for the lambda-calculus plus
constants:
<pre>letrec eval env e =
  case e of
    Cn n: Num n,
    Vr x: env x,
    Lm x e: Fun (\v. 
             let env y = if x=y then v else env y
             in eval env e),
    Ap e1 e2:case eval env e1 of
               Fun f: f (eval env e2)
             esac
  esac
in

eval (\i.Wrong)

(Ap (Ap (Lm (lift "x") (Lm (lift "f") 
          (Ap (Vr (lift "f")) (Vr (lift "x"))))) (Cn (lift 3)))
    (Lm (lift "z") (Vr (lift "z"))))
</pre>
The interpreter can be specialised as it stands, but since everything
is dynamic then no specialisation occurs. Make the following changes
to the binding-times in the interpreter, along with any other
necessary changes to make specialisation possible, and see how the
results change. 
<ul>
<li> Make the constructors <tt>Cn</tt>, <tt>Vr</tt>, <tt>Lm</tt> and
  <tt>Ap</tt> static.
</li><li> Make the constants and variable names in the program static.
</li><li> Unfold calls of <tt>eval</tt>, if you have not already done so.
</li><li> Make the constructors <tt>Num</tt>, <tt>Fun</tt> and <tt>Wrong</tt> static.
</li></ul>
Have you achieved optimal specialisation? (If not: keep trying.)

What happens if you specialise this interpreter to an <i>ill-typed</i>
lambda-term, such as
<pre>(Ap@ (Cn@ 3) (Cn@ 4))
</pre>
Is this the behaviour you would expect?

<h2>Transforming Polymorphism to Monomorphism</h2>

The type specialiser is not optimal for the polymorphic
lambda-calculus, because both source and residual programs are
simply typed (<i>i.e.</i> monomorphic). However, we can write an 
<i>interpreter</i> for a polymorphic language in the type specialiser's
meta-language. Specialising such an interpreter to a polymorphic
program will translate it into a monomorphic one.

Begin by adding a case to your optimal interpreter from the previous exercise
so that it also interprets a <b>let</b> construct:
<pre>Let x e1 e2
</pre>
represents <b>let</b> x=e1 <b>in</b> e2. Test your interpreter by
specialising it to
<pre>(Let@ "id" (Lm@ "x" (Vr@ "x")) (Ap@ (Vr@ "id") (Cn@ 3)))
</pre>
Make sure that specialisation is still optimal --- that is, you obtain
a corresponding <b>let</b> in the residual program.

What happens if you specialise your interpreter to a program which
<i>requires</i> polymorphism to be well-typed? For example,
<pre>(Let@ "id" (Lm@ "x" (Vr@ "x")) 
   (Ap@ (Ap@ (Vr@ "id") (Vr@ "id")) (Cn@ 3)))
</pre>

Modify your interpreter so that it <i>can</i> be specialised to this
term. You will need to generate <i>two</i> versions of <tt>id</tt> in the
residual program, with two different monotypes --- could polyvariance
be useful perhaps? Following the Hindley-Milner type system, you may
wish to distinguish between lambda-bound and <b>let</b>-bound
variables, where only the latter may be polymorphic.

<h2>Transforming Higher-Order to First-Order</h2>
Higher-order programs can be transformed to first-order ones by
representing function values as data-structures called <i>closures</i>,
consisting of a tag identifying the function, and the values of its
free variables. Function calls are interpreted by calling a dispatch
function which inspects the tag, and then behaves like the function
that the tag identifies. The transformation to first-order form is
called <i>closure conversion</i> or <i>firstification</i>, and is a
little tricky in a typed language. The object of this exercise is to
develop an interpreter for the lambda-calculus, which when
specialised to a lambda-term produces the result of firstifying it.

Start from the optimal interpreter you developed <a href="#optspec">above</a>.
Can you change the representation of functions in
the interpreter in such a way that <i>residual</i> functions will be
represented by tagged tuples of their free variables? Don't forget to
introduce a dispatching function, which can be specialised to produce
the dispatch function in the firstified code! A suitable
lambda-expression to test your firstifier on is
<pre>(Ap@ (Lm@ "ap" (Ap@ (Ap@ (Vr@ "ap") (Lm@ "z" (Vr@ "z")))
                    (Ap@ (Ap@ (Vr@ "ap") (Lm@ "w" (Cn@ 3)))
                         (Cn@ 4))))
     (Lm@ "f" (Lm@ "x" (Ap@ (Vr@ "f") (Vr@ "x")))))
</pre>

<i>You may encounter an <i>infinite representation</i> error from the
  arity raiser during this exercise. Certain recursive static
  functions can cause this problem. In this case, try passing the
  dispatch function as a parameter to <tt>eval</tt> rather than
  referring to it as a free variable.</i>

<h2>Interpreting Imperative Programs</h2>
Below is an interpreter for a simple imperative language, supporting
assignments, conditional statements, and sequencing. Variables in the
interpreted language need not be declared: a variable is given a value
simply by assigning to it. The interpreter given below is purely
dynamic; your job is to modify it so that the program to be
interpreted, and the names in the environment, are static.
<pre>let look env x = env x in
let assign env x v = 
   \i. if i=x then v else env i
in

letrec eval env e =
  case e of
    Con n: n,
    Var s: look env s,
    Add e1 e2: eval env e1 + eval env e2
  esac
in

letrec exec env p =
  case p of
    Skip: env,
    Assign x e: assign env x (eval env e),
    Seq p1 p2: let env=exec env p1 in exec env p2,
    If e p1 p2: if eval env e=lift 0 then exec env p2 
                else exec env p1
  esac
in

let run p e = let env = exec (\i.lift 0) p in
              eval env e
in

run
(Seq (Assign (lift "x") (Con (lift 3)))
     (Seq (If (Var (lift "x"))
              (Assign (lift "y") (Add (Var (lift "x")) (Con (lift 1))))
              Skip)
          (Assign (lift "z") (Var (lift "y")))))

(Add (Var (lift "x")) (Var (lift "y")))
</pre>

This interpreter would be difficult to specialise with a partial
evaluator, because of the dynamic conditional in the function
<tt>exec</tt>, which forces the result of <tt>exec</tt> to be dynamic. But
<tt>exec</tt> returns the environment, which should of course be
partially static. Luckily the type specialiser allows dynamic
conditionals to have partially static results, so the problem will not
arise.

One solution using a partial evaluator would be to use <i>CPS
  specialisation</i>, which specialises the context of a dynamic
conditional with partially static branches <i>twice</i>, once in each
branch. In the example above, the statement following the <tt>If</tt>
statement would need to be `compiled' twice (that is, two different
specialisations of <tt>exec</tt> to this statement would need to be
generated), since one branch of the <tt>If</tt> introduces the variable
<tt>y</tt> into the environment, while the other branch does not. Thus
the partially static environment would have a different shape,
depending on which branch of the conditional statement was chosen, and
the reference to <tt>y</tt> in
<pre>(Assign (lift "z") (Var (lift "y")))
</pre>
would need to be compiled differently in each case. The type
specialiser on the other hand `compiles' this last statement once
only. Inspect the residual code: how is the problem of different
variables in the environment after each branch of an <tt>If</tt>
resolved?

In the interpreter given above, uninitialised variables have the value
zero. Modify the interpreter to distinguish between initialised and
uninitialised variables in the environment. What is the effect of
making this distinction static, in the example above?
