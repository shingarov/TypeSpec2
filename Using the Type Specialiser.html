<h1>Using the Type Specialiser</h1>

<h2>Invoking the Specialiser</h2>

The type specialiser is a Haskell program called Main, which reads a
term to specialise from standard input, performs a two-level type
check, and then writes the corresponding residual type and term to the
standard output. For example (user input highlighted):
<pre>hemma# <b>Main</b>
<b>lift (1 + 2)</b>
Main: Error: in 2-level type checking: cannot unify
    Base@
and Base
hemma# <b>Main</b>
<b>lift (1 +@ 2)</b>
Residual type: int

Residual code:
3
</pre>
For all but the smallest inputs it's wise to place the term in a file,
edit the file in one window, and run the specialiser in another.<p>

If you are using the online demo, just type the term to be specialised into
the input window, and press the button labelled <b>Specialise!</b>

</p><h2>Syntax of Source Terms</h2>

Source terms are expressed in a simple functional language based on
the monomorphic two-level lambda-calculus. Static constructs are normally
marked by a `@' sign. A simplified grammar is given below. Here *
denotes repetition zero or more times, + denotes repetition one or
more times, square brackets surround optional parts, and curly
brackets denote grouping.
<pre>e ::= \ [@] id. e
   |  let [@] lhs = e in e
   |  letrec [@] lhs = e in e
   |  case [@] e of cases esac
   |  if [@] e then e else e
   |  poly e
   |  spec e
   |  e op [@] e
   |  e [@] e
   |  prim e
   |  conid [@] e*
   |  id
   |  num
   |  str
   |  true
   |  false
   |  void
   |  (e)
   |  (e,e)

lhs ::= [poly] id {[@] id}*
cases ::= br | br, cases
br ::= conid id* : e
op ::= + | - | * | / | =
prim ::= fst | snd | lift

id ::= lowercase alphanum*
conid ::= uppercase alphanum*
num ::= digit+
str ::= " nonquote* "
</pre>
Comments may be enclosed in comment brackets {- like this -}, or
preceded by -- (which extends to the end of the line).

<h2>Meaning of Source Programs</h2>

<h3>Constants</h3>
Constants (numbers, booleans, and strings) are all static, and all of
the same type <tt>Base@</tt> (so that equality need not be
overloaded). They specialise to void terms, with a residual type
containing the constant's value. Dynamic constants are obtained using
<tt>lift</tt>. The special constant <tt>void</tt> (with type
<tt>void</tt>) is usually transformed away by the arity raiser.

<h3>Lifting</h3>
Expressions of type <tt>Base@</tt> can be lifted; <tt>lift e</tt> has
type <tt>Base</tt>, and specialises to a constant in the residual
program. The residual type is <tt>int</tt>, <tt>bool</tt> or
<tt>string</tt> as appropriate.

<h3>Operators</h3>
The four arithmetic operators and an equality test are available, in
both static and dynamic variants.

<h3>Pairs</h3>
Pairs may appear in source terms, and their components selected using
<tt>fst</tt> and <tt>snd</tt>. They specialise to pairs in the
residual program. <i>However, all pairs are then transformed away by
the arity raiser</i>. To obtain the effect of a `dynamic pair', use a
named constructor instead.

<h3>Constructors</h3>
Names beginning with a capital letter are constructors, as in
Haskell. Constructors may have any number of arguments,
including zero -- for example, in the expression
<pre>Cons 1 (Cons 2 Nil)
</pre>
then <tt>Cons</tt> has two arguments, while <tt>Nil</tt> has
zero. Static constructors are followed by <tt>@</tt> -- for example,
<pre>Cons@ 1 (Cons@ 2 Nil@)
</pre>
Constructed values may be inspected using a <tt>case</tt> expression,
such as
<pre>case xs of
  Nil: lift 0,
  Cons x xs1: lift 1 + length xs1
esac
</pre>
The patterns need not be exhaustive.
Static case expressions have a `<tt>@</tt>' <i>after the keyword
<tt>case</tt></i> (not in the patterns).
<p>
Constructors need not be declared; the type checker automatically infers
the necessary type declarations (even recursive ones). The same
constructor name can be used in many different types, even with
different arities. Static and dynamic constructors cannot be mixed in
the same type, however.
</p><p>
Static constructors are elided from residual terms, but are recorded in
residual types, while dynamic constructors remain in residual
programs, where once again all necessary type declarations are
inferred.

</p><h3>Constructor Specialisation</h3>

There is a special constructor, <tt>In</tt>, which is subject to
<i>constructor specialisation.</i>  An expression <tt>In e</tt> has
type <tt>sum</tt> <i>&lt;type of e&gt;</i>, and is specialised to <tt>Ini
e'</tt> for some integer <tt>i</tt>. Its residual type has the form
<pre>In0 t0 | In1 t1 | ... | Ink tk
</pre>
where <tt>ti</tt> is the type of <tt>e'</tt>. A case expression over
this type is specialised to a case with one branch for each of the
<tt>Ini</tt>. <tt>In</tt> may be used with any number of components.

<h3>Conditionals</h3>
Both static and dynamic conditional expressions are available. The
condition must have type <tt>Base@</tt> or <tt>Base</tt> respectively.

<h3>Functions</h3>

Static and dynamic lambda expressions are available, along with static
and dynamic forms of application. Dynamic functions specialise to
functions in the residual program, while static functions are unfolded
by the specialiser. Static lambda expressions specialise to tuples of
their free variables -- the function body becomes part of its residual
type. These tuples are subject to arity raising.

<h3>Polyvariance</h3>

Polyvariant specialisation is provided via an expression <tt>poly
e</tt> (of type <tt>poly t</tt>), which specialises to a tuple of
specialisations of <tt>e</tt> (of type <tt>t</tt>). When a polyvariant
value is used it must first be <i>specialised</i>: <tt>spec e</tt>
extracts a <tt>t</tt> from a value of type <tt>poly t</tt>, and
specialises to an appropriate selection from the tuple. These tuples
are subject to arity raising.

<h3>Definitions</h3>

Local definitions can be made: non-recursive ones with <tt>let</tt>,
and recursive ones with <tt>letrec</tt>. (Only a single definition is
allowed in each case). Dynamic <tt>let</tt>s and <tt>letrec</tt>s
generate corresponding constructions in residual programs, while
static definitions are unfolded by the specialiser.  <p> Syntactic
sugar allows functions to be defined using the usual
</p><pre>f x y z ... = e
</pre>
notation, which is equivalent to <tt>f =
\x.\y.\z. ...e</tt>. Preceding a formal parameter with <tt>@</tt>
binds it with a static lambda; preceding the entire definition with
<tt>poly</tt> makes the entire function polyvariant. For example,
<pre>letrec poly power n x = e in ...
</pre> is sugar for
<pre>letrec power = poly \n. \x. e in ...
</pre>

Do not define a <i>recursive</i> unfoldable function with a
<i>dynamic</i> <tt>letrec</tt>: the result is a cyclic structure with
an infinite representation after arity raising. Use a static
definition in this case; for example
<pre>letrec@ power @n @x = if@ n=@1 then x else x*power@(n-@1)@x in...
</pre>

<h2>Arity Raising</h2>

The arity raiser is a post-processor which eliminates product types
from the residual program. Every expression is replaced by a possibly
empty sequence of expressions representing its `components'. For
example, <tt>\x. (x,2)</tt> is arity-raised to <tt>(\x.x,
\x.2)</tt>. Bound variables are similarly transformed. Then function
parameters are replaced by a sequence of parameters (currying), data
structure components are replaced by a sequence of components,
<tt>let</tt> declarations are replaced by a sequence of declarations
and so on. Arity raising can duplicate code, so be careful! Some
expressions may have infinitely many components: this causes the arity
raiser to stop and report an error.
<p>
To experiment with the arity raiser, give a completely dynamic term
containing pairs to the specialiser. The residual term will be
essentially the same as the source term, and you will be able to study
the effect of the arity raiser in isolation. For example,
</p><pre>hemma# <b>Main</b>
<b>let x = (lift 1, lift 2) in x</b>
Residual type: (int,int)

Residual code:
(let x_1 = 1
     x_2 = 2
 in x_1,
 let x_1 = 1
     x_2 = 2
 in x_2)
</pre>
Here the definition of <tt>x</tt> has been arity-raised to a
definition of each component, but the result of the entire program has
also been arity raised to a pair of programs, duplicating the
<tt>let</tt> expression. To avoid such duplication, apply a dynamic
constructor to the result:
<pre>hemma# <b>Main</b>
<b>let x = (lift 1, lift 2) in Foo x</b>
Residual type: (int,int)

Residual code:
let x_1 = 1
    x_2 = 2
in Foo x_1 x_2
</pre>
